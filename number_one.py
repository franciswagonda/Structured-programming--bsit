#Question One (6 Marks)
#Differentiate Between Assigning and Declaring a variable giving practical Examples of Each 
"""
Assigning a variable means putting a specific value into that reserved space
using workks with an operator

for example
age = 8


while

Declaring a variable means reserving a space in memory to store a value and giving that space a name

for example

a = 10        # Declaring an integer variable named 'a'

b = 20.5      # Declaring a float variable named 'b' 

c = 'hello'   # Declaring a string variable named 'c'

"""

##Question Two (4 Marks)
##Given the code below

##age = "8"
##length = “56.90”
##height = “34.09944”
## convert the variable age to integer datatype

age = 8
new_age = float(age)
print(f"float: {new_age}")


length = 56.90
new_length = int(length)
print(f'integer: {new_length}')


height = 34.0994
new_height = int(height)
print(f"integer: {new_height}")
